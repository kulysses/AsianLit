col001,1.jpg,The Analects by Confucius,"Though most Confucian values are not applicable to Filipino modern society, I still do think certain values, such as filial piety, are embedded or reflected in the dynamics of a Filipino family, as well. In Line XVIII, it is stated “in serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice; he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur.” The last line, specifically, can be reflected when reprimanding us and when we decide to explain our side, parents directly refute “Aba! At sumasagot-sagot ka na, ha?! [Wow! And you are answering back now, huh?!”]. This aligns, then, to the Filipino value of obedience to parents, a typically cited fifth commandment of “Honor[ing] thy father and mother.”",image/jpeg
col002,2.jpg,The Ramayana ,"A quintessential Indian epic, the story line draws parallels to popular Indian epics in the course of our literature’s history such as Indarapatra at Sulayman and Biag ni Lam-ang. One particular aspect that correlates to Filipino perspectives, however, is Sita’s character of obedience to the protagonist Ramayana. Though it is widely raised against sexist ideals in modern times, unfortunately, some people still perceive women to be of lesser status than men. This is reflected in the text, saying under the third chapter, “[d]earer is her husband’s shadow to the loved and loving wife,” depicting as if women merely exist to serve their husbands when it comes to marriage. This aligns with expectations that entail added pressure to women to be wed, most specifically before the “ripe” age of 30. One way or another, it can also be attributed to the pristine qualities attached to a popular Rizal character “Maria Clara.” Established gender roles are changing in the modern times, however. Moreover, though not added in my literature collection, The Last Rite by Lee Yu-Hwa tells of the contextualization of these pressures within the family toward marriage; and how, ultimately, cultural values that we are told to be familiarized with and imbibe affects our socialization and worldview.

","Though the stories depict disattached scenes to the Filipino reality, the main premises the stories entail still ring importance to our own experience. These two stories tackled the importance of assessment of truth, especially with our current politics and society that is marred by disinformation. More particularly, the undeniable power of revisionism of a certain Filipino clan towards the critical points in history that speaks of their injustices. Though perspectives can differ regarding a certain topic, as expressed in the two Japanese writers’ puzzling stories, it is crucial that we speak and assess our own truth in our daily experiences.

col004,4.png,“Karma” by Khushwant Singh,"Though contextualized in the Indian context, Karma tells us of an ongoing problem towards internalized racism and racism among groups of people that is reflected, as well, in Philippine society. In our context, it does not go merely on our established stereotypes on other races, but even on our own. Colorism—that favors people who have fair skin over those who possess darker skin—tells of this on-going problem. It is with hope that we refrain ourselves from participating in this, especially since there must be nothing to be ashamed of in our appearances in the first place. This preference, however, can be attributed to “colonial mentality” which, of course, includes qualities of the Western. This, then leads to distaste and dislike towards our own features which, in itself, is problematic. Going beyond this, of course, is the preference for anything foreign which leads to inferior perspectives toward our own. The lead character, Mohan Lal, is a testament to this on his preference of British ideals.",image/png
col005,5.jpg,“Eyewitness” by Sena Ajidarma,"This perhaps has the most reflection to Philippine society nowadays, that Filipinos show complacency to be against those who speak the “truth,” whether with evidence or not. Though the story is situated in the Indonesian context, it speaks correlatively to how witnesses of justice and truth are silenced or doubted, such as journalists, for example. This happened, most essentially, during the period of Martial Law against those who decidedly speak against the Marcos government. Due to injustices that violently transpired during that dark period, it is crucial for the Filipino to never forget.",image/jpeg
col006,6.jpg,Additional notes,"Though I have not included other texts tackled in class (e.g. due to their disconnection to Filipino values and beliefs) I deem it essential, then, that Asian literature is a great platform to draw similarities among Asian experiences. It is important that as we read them, we question our own morals, attitudes, and outlook toward everyday discourses about salient issues. This also comprises ones that are already established in history, written in stone, as if they must not be challenged or reflected upon, affirmed or disagreed with. After all, it is in this constant stream of curiosity that we truly formulate what it means to be a Filipino. What I gleaned from the sources are merely a testament to my own observations. It is up to us to be a critical thinker (in literature and society) that will interrelate pre-existing notions and decide if we ascribe them into our own worldview.",image/jpeg
